# Dialoguer
Dialogue GIF Generator made to be as customizable as Godot allows me to!

# Current Features
- Ability to type out text in a typewritter style akin to Undertale.
- Ability to spesify amost everything about any line, including font, size, color, icons, custum textboxes, delays, and more!
- Intigrated BBCode Support for things like [color], [wave], [shake], [tornado] and [rainbow]!
- Thats really about it lol

# Instructions
To create a Dialogue file, follow these Steps:
1. Open the Program at least once. thisll generate the folders youll need for your textboxes in your Documents Folder under 'Documents/Dialoguer Assets/'.
2. Go to 'Dialoguer Assets/Dialogue' and create an empty document/empty text file.
3. Name it whatever you want and make it a JSON file. (if you made an empty text file, replace the .txt at the end with .json)
4. Start typing! In the downloaded ZIP file you should find two files called 'info.json' and 'test_dialog.json', the former showing all available variables and the latter showing an example of how to use some of them.

# Future Plans
I want to expand this Project further and add even more stuff so if you have ideas or know stuff about Godot and would like to help out, reach out over discord (xanderxrr) and leave feedback, ill try making this thing as good as i can :3
