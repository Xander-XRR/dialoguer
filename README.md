# Dialoguer
Undertale style Dialogue Generator made to be as customizable as Godot allows me to make it!

# Current Features
- Ability to type out text in a typewritter style akin to Undertale.
- Ability to spesify amost everything about any line, including font, font size, icons, custum textboxes, text-, icon- and textbox color, delays, and more.
- Intigrated BBCode Support [(color], [wave], [shake], [tornado] and [rainbow]).
- Ability to make PNG and GIF Files.
- Thats really about it lol

# Instructions
To create a Dialogue File, follow these Steps:
1. Install ffmpeg, its the program used to generate certain files.
2. Open Dialoguer at least once. It will automatically generate the folders you'll need for your assets in your Documents Folder under `Documents/Dialoguer Assets`.
3. Go to `/Dialoguer Assets/Dialogue` and create an empty document/empty text file.
4. Name it whatever you want and make it a JSON file. (if you made an empty text file, replace the .txt at the end with .json)
5. Start typing! In the GitHub Page, theres a `Dialoguer Assets` Folder with some Stuff already in it, so feel free to check it out to see how everything works! (Spesifically, look in `Dialoguer Assets/Dialogue` or look in `variables.txt` to find some examples/info!)
6. Run the program, put the Files desired Name in the first field, the JSON file in `Dialoguer Assets/Dialogue`s Name and select the Format, then start.
7. It'll show the textbox typing the characters out, so if you wanna change anything simply make that change and try again!
8. Open the Output Folder and enjoy your Generated Textbox!

**NOTE**: Launching it from your OSs Terminal will allow you to see a bunch of debugging text, so if you get stuck it may be worth checking out.

**NOTE**: For now, when something goes wrong and the program doesn't seem to continue with the dialogue, force-close it and clear the Frames Folder on startup. Clearing the leftover frames is always recommended as it might mess with your future GIFs otherwise.

# Future Plans
Currently Planned Features:
- Better UI
- Better Bad File/Crash prevention
- More overall polish

I want to expand this Project further and add even more stuff so if you have ideas or know stuff about Godot and would like to help out, reach out over discord (xanderxrr) and leave feedback, i'll try making this thing as good as i can. :3
